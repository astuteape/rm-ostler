    <!-- blurb -->
    <p>What does it mean to talk like an American? According to John Russell Bartlett's 1848
        <em>Dictionary of Americanisms,</em> it means indulging in outlandish slang&mdash;
        <em>splendiferous, scrumptious, higgeldy-piggedly</em>&mdash;and free-and-easy word creation&mdash;
        <em>demoralize, lengthy, gerrymander.</em> American English is about more than new words, though. It's a picturesque
        way of talking that features expressions inspired by everyday life&mdash;
        <em>save someone's bacon, go the whole hog, bark up the wrong tree.</em> Hyperbole and tall talk are also part of the
        mix. The frontiersman Davy Crockett, who claimed to be "half horse, half alligator, and a touch of the airthquake,"
        was a quintessential American language user.</p>
    <p>
        <em>Splendiferous Speech</em> explores the main sources of the vernacular English that made it into Bartlett's dictionary.
        These include the expanding western frontier, the bumptious world of politics, and the sensation-filled pages of
        popular nineteenth-century newspapers. American language invention started with the earliest English colonists (first
        word adoptionï¿½the Algonquian
        <em>raccoon</em>) and is still going strong today. Come along on the journey as Americans learn to declare linguistic
        independence and embrace their own brand of English. For anyone who wonders how we got from the language of King
        James to the slang of the Internet, it's an exhilarating ride.</p>
