    <p>Welcome to my website! I'm a linguist and freelance writer living in Eugene, Oregon. My writing focuses on language-related
        topics, including American English, word histories, and grammar and style. I especially love delving into the rich
        record of American language use. My new book, the forthcoming
        <a href="index.html">Splendiferous Speech,</a> recounts the lively history of how early Americans declared linguistic independence and
        learned to embrace their own brand of English. Previous
        <a href="books.html">books</a> about America's colorful linguistic past explore obsolete twentieth-century slang, the origins of our most
        common expressions, the country's long tradition of outrageous political invective, and the centuries-long fight
        over what constitutes proper grammar.</p>

    <p>My
        <a href="clips.html">articles</a> cover a broad range of topics, from the fate of endangered languages to plain English for business owners.
        My byline has appeared in
        <em>The Saturday Evening Post, American History, Christian Science Monitor, Whole Earth, Atlas Obscura, Entrepreneur.com,</em>
        and
        <em>Elks Magazine</em>, among other places. I have written about research, usage, and style for
        <em>Writer's Digest and The Writer,</em> as well as teaching workshops on research for writers and book proposal basics.
        I also put my skills to use with nonfiction editing and book coaching. I am a member of the American Society of Journalists
        and Authors and the Dictionary Society of North America.</p>
