## Templates from Rosemarie for Inspiration

* [Read](https://themeforest.net/item/read-responsive-html5-minimalist-template/3772717?s_rank=1) Responsive HTML5 Minimalist Template

  * I like the very clean, uncluttered design and the fact that it's not a one-page. Also, the Portfolio design could work for my books and articles. I don't need a search function and the first page would need to be static.

* [Cygnus](https://themeforest.net/item/cygnus-clean-and-minimalistic-portfolio-theme/19227080?s_rank=1) — clean and minimalistic portfolio theme

  * I like the minimalist look, and the portfolio templates could work for my books and articles.

* [Hendrix](https://themeforest.net/item/hendrix-personal-portfolio-html-template/21232932?s_rank=1) Personal Portfolio HTML Template

  * I like the typography and uncluttered layout, and I think the way "Recent Works" is set up could work for my books. On the minus side, it's one page and the top is a bit flashy for my taste -- I wouldn’t want moving letters.

* [Readme](https://themeforest.net/item/readme-a-readable-wordpress-theme/9167043?s_rank=1)
  * Liked the way the Books page is set up, but decided there are too many bells and whistles that I wouldn't use.
